## Best practices for smart contract 
***Use getter function instead making every variable public***

***Try to avoid hardcoding as much as possible through some config files like HelperConfig in this project***

***Use cheetCodes for simulate testing behaviour ,genrating testing arguments , protocal testing.***

***Always use the standard way of approaching Test through "AAA" Arrange,Act,Asssert, check one test at a time.***
